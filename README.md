# Predicting-the-species-of-flower-for-a-given-input-image

The Flowers-17 dataset is a 17-category dataset with 80 images per class which is available in the datasets_final.zip folder

The goal of this dataset is to correctly predict the species of flower for a given input image.

## Steps

Read the dataset images and associated labels from the folder structure.

Classified the dataset using logistic regression, K-NN, and neural networks (two hidden layers).

Compared the performances and showed the confusion matrices (20% test images and 80% training images).

Performed a K-means clustering in the image dataset and showed the optimal number of clusters.

I created a new test dataset of 10 images. We predicted the flower type by using the three classifiers above.
