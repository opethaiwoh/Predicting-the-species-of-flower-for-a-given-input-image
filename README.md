# Predicting-the-species-of-flower-for-a-given-input-image

The Flowers-17 dataset is a 17-category dataset with 80 images per class which is available in the datasets_final.zip folder

The goal of this dataset is to correctly predict the species of flower for a given input image.

Figure: A sample of five (out of the seventeen total) classes in the Flowers-17 dataset

## Steps

Read the dataset images and associated labels from the folder structure

Classify the dataset using Logistic Regression, K-NN and Neural Network (two hidden layers)

Compared the performances and show the confusion matrices (20% test images and 80% training images)

Performed a K-means clustering in the image dataset and show the optimal number of cluster (Hint: Elbow method)

Created a new test dataset of 10 images (download any flower images from internet or any other resources)

Predicted the flower type by using the above 3 classifiers.
